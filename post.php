        <p class="post__body">These species rank as the first flowers found to fluoresce naturally
            in peoples visible-light range, says Fernando Gandía-Herrero of the University of Murcia
            in Spain. Some other plant pigments emit fluorescent light in the ultraviolet range.
            Flowers such as four-o-clocks and portulacas invented the fluorescent look long before the
            psychedelic 1960s with its black light posters, new research shows.
            The yellowish pigments that give the visible glow are called betaxanthins. These pigments
            show up in four-o-clocks (Mirabilis jalapa), portulacas, and certain other flashy flowers
            related to carnations, cacti, and bougainvilleas. Previous research on the pigments missed
            their capacity to fluoresce, says Gandía-Herrero.In three recent papers, Gandía-Herrero and
            his colleagues report that blue light excites betaxanthin pigments to glow yellowish green.
            In the Sept. 15 Nature, the researchers report that four-o’clocks have both fluorescent and
            antifluorescent pigments. The parts of the flower that look yellow are also emitting green
            fluorescent light. Other parts of the flower contain both betaxanthin and a violet pigment,
            betanin, which absorbs most of the fluorescence emissions. The combination of these pigments
            might create patterns that attract pollinators, Gandía-Herrero speculates.</p>
